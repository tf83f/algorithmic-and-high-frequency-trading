This repository contains my personal notes, implementations, and experiments based on advanced topics in **Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading** by Jos√© Penalva, Sebastian Jaimungal, and √Ålvaro Cartea.

The goal of this repository is to serve as a reference for understanding key concepts, strategies, and techniques used in modern algorithmic and high-frequency trading.

## üìñ About

The notebooks are designed to:

- Explore mathematical foundations and statistical models.
- Implement and experiment with trading algorithms.
- Analyze financial data and market microstructure.
- Simulate trading strategies under realistic constraints.
- Deepen understanding of high-frequency trading concepts.

This collection is **not introductory** and assumes prior knowledge in areas such as:

- Statistics and probability.
- Financial instruments and markets.
- Programming, especially in Python.
- Linear algebra, calculus, and optimization.
